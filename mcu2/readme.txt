General MCU 2 information ;;

We've chose an attiny2313 as the MCU that will be interfacing with the sensors , PIR , LDR , Temperature sensor 

Temperature sensor : we've chosen the maxim integrated DS18B20 , which features a digital single wire interface .

PIR motion sensor  : we've chosen the HC-SR501  as the motion sensor .

LDR : just an LDR I guess.

Motor driver : L911 or an L293D doesn't matter which .
